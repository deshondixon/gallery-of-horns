## Reference
Viewed Harpers and Jason's code to figure out how to connect my selectedbeast changed so much stuff for no reason came to find out I just had my data named incorrectly so the data wasn't going into my selectedbeast.js

There's no way in the world I would've been able to figure out the forms without Sheyna using todd's code as an example in class.
